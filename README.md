Coffee Inc.
==========

CoffeeInc is a simple, hacky game built as a university project by students of the Free University of Bolzano.
The assignment was to build a game that teaches the basics of the startup world, in a fun way.

Our game is basically a mobile website (based on the Lungo.js framework) with some custom Javascript.

## Why the game is cool
* It uses some fancy new web technologies like localstorage
* All assets are 100% vector (SVG images)
* Even animations are vector (SVGs are swapped out with JS)
* We use a custom icon font for the monochrome icons in the UI
 
## Problems 
* Bugs
* Lots of ugly hacks
* Doesn't work in most browsers 

## Browser Support
The game (mostly) works in:
* Chromium on GNU/Linux
* Chrome for Android (although with weird SVG rendering bugs)

The game kinda works in:
* Firefox on GNU/Linux (Lungo.js related styling problems)
* Firefox for Android

The game doesn't work in:
* Internet Explorer on any platform
* Safari mobile

##How to run the game

1. Install a local webserver
2. Git clone (or download) this repository into your localhost folder
3. Open localhost/c3 in your browser (or even better, open yourpc'slocalip/c3 on your mobile device)
4. Profit
