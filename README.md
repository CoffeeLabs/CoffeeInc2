Coffee Inc.
==========

Coffee Inc. is a simple, hacky game built as a university project by students of the Free University of Bolzano.
The assignment was to build a game that teaches the basics of the startup world, in a fun way.

Our game is basically a mobile website (based on the Lungo.js framework) with some custom Javascript.

## Why the game is cool
* It uses some fancy new web technologies like localstorage
* All assets are 100% vector (SVG images)
* Even animations are vector (SVGs are swapped out with JS)
* Responsive layout
* We use a custom icon font for the monochrome icons in the UI
 
## Issues 
* Bugs
* Lots of ugly hacks
* Doesn't work in mostany browsers

## Browser Support
The game works best in:
* Chromium 24 on GNU/Linux

The game kinda works in:
* Firefox 18 on GNU/Linux (Lungo.js related styling problems)
* Firefox 18 for Android (Lungo.js related styling problems)
* Firefox 18 on OSX 10.8 (Icon font looks like crap)
* Chrome 24 for Windows (Icon font looks like crap)
* Chrome 24 on OSX 10.8 (fonts look like crap)
* Chrome for Android (some weird SVG rendering bugs)
* Android 4.1 stock browser (some weird SVG rendering bugs)
* Safari on OSX 10.8 (some weird SVG rendering bugs)

The game doesn't work in:
* Internet Explorer (Windows 7 and Windows Phone 7)
* Midori on GNU/Linux
* Epiphany 3.6 on GNU/Linux
* Android 2 stock browser

##How to run the game

1. Install a local webserver
2. Git clone (or download) this repository into your localhost folder
3. Open localhost/c3 in your browser (or even better, open yourpcslocalip/c3 on your mobile device)
4. Profit
